## Local Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone the Repo**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-provider-latitudesh.git
cd terraform-provider-latitudesh
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) >= 1.23.x
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) >= 1.6

3. **Configure Terraform for Local Development**

Create or edit your `~/.terraformrc` file with a dev override pointing to your local build path:

```sh
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "local/iac/latitudesh" = "/Users/your-username/Developer/latitudesh/terraform-provider-latitudesh"
  }
  direct {}
}
```

This tells Terraform to use your local provider build instead of downloading it from the registry.

4. **Build the Provider**
```sh
make build
```

5. **Running tests**
```sh
make test
```

## Using Your Local Build

In your Terraform project, configure the provider like this:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    latitudesh = {
      source = "local/iac/latitudesh"
    }
  }
}

provider "latitudesh" {}
```

Now run:

```sh
rm -rf .terraform .terraform.lock.hcl
terraform init
```

Terraform will pick up your local build through the override configured in `~/.terraformrc`.

> **Note:** Remove any `version` line from `required_providers` to ensure Terraform always uses your local build.
