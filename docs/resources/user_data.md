## Schema

### Required

- `content` (String) Base64 encoded content of the User Data
- `description` (String) The User Data description
- `project` (String, Deprecated) The id or slug of the project

### Read-Only

- `updated` (String) The timestamp for the last time the User Data was updated

## Import

You can import a User Data resource using either the CLI method or the new [experimental import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import).

**CLI Import**

The `latitudesh_user_data` resource can be imported by specifying its ID:

```sh
$ terraform import latitudesh_user_data.user_data <USER_DATA_ID>
```

**Import Block (Experimental)**

Terraform v1.5.0 and later supports the experimental import block, which allows you to define imports in your configuration. This feature is experimental and may change in future Terraform releases. See the [Terraform documentation for details](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import).

To use this method, create a file named `import.tf` (or any `.tf` file) with the following content:

```hcl
import {
  to = latitudesh_user_data.user_data
  id = "<USER_DATA_ID>"
}
```

Then run:

```sh
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated_user_data.tf
```

This will generate the resource configuration for the imported user data resource.

> **Note:** The import block feature is experimental and its syntax or behavior may change in future Terraform versions.
