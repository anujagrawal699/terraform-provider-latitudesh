# latitudesh_tag (Resource)

Latitude.sh supports resource tagging to help you organize and manage your infrastructure more effectively.
Tags allow you to categorize resources, making it easier to search, filter, and group them based on your specific needs.

## Example usage

```hcl
resource "latitudesh_tag" "tag" {
  name        = "Tag Name"
  description = "Tag Description"
  color       = "#ff0000"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `color` (String) The tag color (hex color code, e.g., #ff0000). The API normalizes colors to lowercase.
- `name` (String) The tag name

### Optional

- `description` (String) The tag description

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

You can import a Tag resource using either the CLI method or the [experimental import block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import).

**CLI Import**

The `latitudesh_tag` resource can be imported by specifying the Tag ID:

```sh
terraform import latitudesh_tag.tag <TAG_ID>
```

**Import Block (Experimental)**

Terraform v1.5.0 and later supports the experimental import block, which allows you to define imports in your configuration. This feature is experimental and may change in future Terraform releases. See the [Terraform documentation for details](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import).

To use this method, create a file named `import.tf` (or any `.tf` file) with the following content:

```hcl
import {
  to = latitudesh_tag.tag
  id = "<TAG_ID>"
}
```

Then run:

```sh
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated_tag.tf
```

This will generate the resource configuration for the imported tag resource.

> **Note:** The import block feature is experimental and its syntax or behavior may change in future Terraform versions.
